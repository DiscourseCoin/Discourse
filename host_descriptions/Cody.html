<p>Cody was born from the fiery pits of Mount Korea. He escaped after he learned of the magical land of 'MERICA. With the promise of great oppurtunity and
	titties he couldn't resist. Also, Americans eat a lot of bacon, and bacon is god. You can do everything with that shit, you can wrap hot dogs in it, you can
	dip it in chocolate, hell you can eat plain bacon and it is still damn delicious. If you're out with a girl and things aren't goin too smooth just whip out
	some bacon and let that ho taste some salty hog... trust me on this one.</p>
	
	<p>Anyways, back to Cody, he does not posess super powers in his chin like Slugger, BUT
	he can do backflips, run up walls, be one with the shadows, and fit into very small places, which pretty much makes him a ninja. But he only uses his ninja
	powers to play pranks and perform unspeakable acts on your mom (moms be warned). So in summary, yay bacon, yay ninjas, yay moms!</p>
